# comp230-pre-production

One of my first contributions for our game, Sol Tenebrae, is the enemy AI blueprint. I started with that then it was eventually built upon by my programmer peer and the designers. Additionally, I implemented the health pickup blueprint as well as the health drop, where the enemies have a 1/3 chance (editable) of dropping health on death. I also made an inputbuffer system (with help from a tutorial online) that was supposed to work along with our combo system, e.g. resetting the moves used after a small period of time. However, this wasn't implemented as a result of random issues that arose with UE4. It was later decided that this wasn't our top priority and might get worked on again later on.

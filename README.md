# comp230-pre-production

One of my contributions for our game, Sol Tenebrae, is the enemy AI blueprint. I started with that then it was eventually built upon by my programmer peer and the designers. Additionally, I implemented the health pickup blueprint as well as the health drop, where the enemies have a 1/3 chance (editable) of dropping health. I also helped with our immense combo system, although that was majorly done by our designers.
